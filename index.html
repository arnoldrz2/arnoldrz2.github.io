			Hello World! I love tech, music, politics, psychology, and (most importantly) video games! I graduated from Texas State University-San Marcos with a BA in Psychology. I've worked at a non-profit for several years, first as a social worker and then as an IT worker. Now, I'm a part time coding student at UT.

			I have three dogs. Their names are Sir WiZard, LayD, and Prim. I was born on January 3rd, so that makes me a Capricorn. My favorite color is green.
